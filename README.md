ConcentricClock
===============

Tell the time in a covert way using spinning concentric arcs.

This is a clock that uses spinning and growing concentric arcs to tell the time, and demonstrates in a dynamic way the
factors of 60. The minute hand is suggested by the start and end positions of the arcs, while the hour of day is shown by the
size of the outer arc.
